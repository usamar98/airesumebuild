-- Create a proper test user using Supabase Auth
-- This will be executed via the Supabase client, not direct SQL

-- First, let's check if we have any existing users
SELECT email, created_at, email_confirmed_at FROM auth.users;

-- Note: We'll need to use the Supabase client to create users properly
-- Direct SQL insertion into auth.users is not recommended
-- This file serves as documentation for the user creation process
