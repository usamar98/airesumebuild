# Railway Deployment Registration Fix

## Issues Identified

The registration works locally but fails on Railway due to environment variable configuration issues. Here's what needs to be fixed:

## üîß Required Railway Environment Variable Updates

### 1. Frontend URL Configuration
**Current Issue:** `FRONTEND_URL=https://your-railway-app-url.railway.app` (placeholder)

**Fix:** Update to your actual Railway app URL:
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-actual-app-name.railway.app
```

### 2. JWT Secret
**Current Issue:** `JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-railway` (placeholder)

**Fix:** Generate a secure JWT secret:
```
JWT_SECRET=your-actual-secure-jwt-secret-here
```

### 3. Email Configuration
**Current Issue:** All email settings are placeholders

**Fix:** Configure with real email service:
```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-actual-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-actual-email@gmail.com
```

### 4. CORS Configuration
**Current Issue:** Backend CORS is set to placeholder URL

**Fix:** The backend will automatically use the FRONTEND_URL for CORS once updated.

## üöÄ Steps to Fix on Railway

1. **Go to your Railway project dashboard**
2. **Click on your service**
3. **Go to Variables tab**
4. **Update these environment variables:**
   - `FRONTEND_URL` ‚Üí Your actual Railway app URL
   - `JWT_SECRET` ‚Üí A secure random string (32+ characters)
   - `EMAIL_HOST` ‚Üí Your email provider's SMTP host
   - `EMAIL_PORT` ‚Üí Your email provider's SMTP port
   - `EMAIL_USER` ‚Üí Your email address
   - `EMAIL_PASS` ‚Üí Your email app password
   - `EMAIL_FROM` ‚Üí Your email address

5. **Redeploy your application**

## üîç Debug Information

The enhanced logging shows:
- ‚úÖ Supabase connection works
- ‚úÖ User creation in Supabase Auth succeeds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile creation sometimes fails with duplicate key error
- ‚úÖ Email verification and analytics tracking work
- ‚ùå CORS issues due to placeholder FRONTEND_URL

## üß™ Testing After Fix

After updating the environment variables:
1. Try registering a new user
2. Check the Railway logs for detailed error information
3. Verify the registration email is sent

## üìù Additional Notes

- The duplicate key error in profile creation is handled gracefully
- Registration still succeeds even if profile creation fails
- The main issue is likely CORS configuration blocking frontend requests
- Email verification requires proper email configuration

## üîó Quick Fix Priority

1. **FRONTEND_URL** (Critical - fixes CORS)
2. **JWT_SECRET** (Critical - fixes authentication)
3. **Email settings** (Important - fixes verification emails)
